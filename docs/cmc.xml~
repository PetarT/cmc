      <title>Introducing CMC</title>

      <para>CMC is a Joomla extension that integrates with the Mailchimp API.
      It#s functionality includes, but is not limited to displaying your
      mailchimp lists and users directly in your Joomla backend. You have a
      Joomla module that lets you easily allow users on your site to register
      for your Mailchimp Newsletter. </para>

            <para>Newsletter subscription. CMC makes it really easy to publish
            your list on a Joomla based website and doesn't require you to
            create any HTML code what so ever.</para>

  <chapter>
    <title>Installation and updates</title>

    <para>Installing CMC is no different than installing any other Joomla!™
    extension on your site. You can read the complete instructions for
    installing Joomla!™ extensions on the <ulink
    url="http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1476/235/">official help
    page</ulink> .Throughout this chapter we assume that you are familiar with
    these instructions and we will not duplicate them.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Getting the installation packages</title>

      <para>You can download the latest installation packages by visiting our
      site at <ulink
      url="https://compojoom.com">https://compojoom.com</ulink>. Go to
      Download -&gt; CMC menu item. The releases are listed in descending
      order with the newest release always on top. Click on the release number
      and then download the ZIP package.</para>

      <para>The installation package can be installed on Joomla 2.5 . You can
      use the installation package to update from previous version as well;
      just install it, without uninstalling the old package.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Updating to the latest version</title>

      <section>
        <title>Checking for the latest version and upgrading</title>

        <para>You can easily check for the latest published version of CMCMC
        by visiting https://compojoom.com and going to
        Downloads-&gt;CMC.</para>

        <para>Updating CMC to the latest version is by no means different than
        installing the component! You do not have to uninstall the previous
        version; in fact, you are discouraged from doing so. Simply follow the
        installation instructions so as to install the latest CMC version over
        the existing installation. That's all! All your settings are
        preserved.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Live update</title>

        <para>There is also an alternate update path, if your server supports
        it. It is called the "Live Update" feature (thanks to Nicholas K.
        Dionysopoulos from http://akeebabackup.com) . Whenever you click on
        the Live update button in the Navigation toolbar, it will
        automatically check for the existence of an updated version and it
        will notify you. Clicking on the update button allows you to perform a
        live update without further interaction (you will need to provide your
        compojoom username and password in order for us to check your
        subscription validity). Do note that if your server is protected by a
        firewall you'll have to enable port 80 and 443 TCP traffic to
        https://compojoom.com for this feature to work properly.</para>
